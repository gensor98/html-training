When pandas reproduce, they give birth to one or occasionally two cubs at a time.Panda cubs are incredibly<br>cute and attract a lot of attention due to their small size and playful behavior.At birth, panda cubs are extremely tiny, weighing only about 90 to<br>130 grams (3 to 4.5 ounces) and measuring around 15 to 17 centimeters (6 to 7 inches) in length. They are born blind and hairless, with their eyes<br>and ears closed.During the first few weeks of their lives,panda cubs are entirely dependent on their mother for nourishment, and protection.<br>  They spend most of their time sleeping and feeding, as their bodies are still developing. As they grow older, they gradually gain weight and start<br>to explore their surroundings.Panda cub has a distinctive white coloration, which gradually turns black over time. Their playful antics and adorable<br>appearances make them a favorite subject for wildlife conservation efforts and attract a lot of public interest and support. Many zoos around the<br>world participate in breeding programs to help conserve this endangered species and raise awareness about the importance of panda conservation.
            <br><p style="font-size:100%; font-family:cursive;">Here is a quote from wikipedia website about a panda cub:
    <blockquote style="font-size:100%; font-family:cursive; border:4px solid black; border-radius: 10px; background-image: url('https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/013/283/010/original/beautiful-landscape-of-mountain-green-forest-or-deep-jungle-with-mountain-heel-and-cloud-sky-beauty-of-nature-and-natural-wallpaper-concept-free-photo.jpg');" cite="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7#%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF_%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7;"><b>    Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies.If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the<br>stronger of the cubs, and the weaker cub will die due to starvation. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs since<br>she does not store fat.<br><mark>a panda cub</mark> weighs between 90-130 grams,which is one eight hundredth of its mother's weight. A panda gives birth to between 1 and 2 cubs,and<br>if there are twin cubs,the mother panda abandons one of them and the cub dies immediately.<br>Currently, scientists do not know how and on what basis the female panda chooses one of the two cubs. Maybe it will release the weaker cub but<br>nothing is proven.(The father does not help the cub grow up.)

He also hunts and eats eggs, birds, insects and small mammals.<br>In terms of appearance, it is different from the black and white bears that we still know as pandas.Its size is only slightly smaller than the larger cats,<br>40-60cm long.<br>There are only 2500 of these animals in the adult type in the whole world,because the habitat of this animal is being destroyed by humans.</td>

This animal is also a herbivore and easily feeds on all the plants in its habitat.</td>
