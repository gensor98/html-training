Efforts have been made to conserve and protect pandas in their<br>natural habitat.They have become a symbol of wildlife conservation and are often associated with environmental awareness.Pandas are known for their gentle demeanor<br>and are often depicted as adorable and cuddly creatures.

        <h2 style="color:orangered; font-size:200%; font-family:cursive;"><i><b><ins>panda cub</ins></b></i><!--I should add next paragraph in my document because we should have information about panda cub--></h2><p style="font-size:100%; font-family:cursive;"><mark>A "panda cub"</mark> refers to a baby panda. When pandas reproduce, they give birth to one or occasionally two cubs at a time.Panda cubs are incredibly cute and attract a lot<br>of attention due to their small size and playful behavior.At birth, panda cubs are extremely tiny, weighing only about 90 to 130 grams (3 to 4.5 ounces) and measuring<br>around 15 to 17 centimeters (6 to 7 inches) in length. They are born blind and hairless, with their eyes and ears closed.During the first few weeks of their lives,panda<br>cubs are entirely dependent on their mother for nourishment, warmth, and protection. They spend most of their time sleeping and feeding, as their bodies are still<br>developing. As they grow older, they gradually gain weight and start to explore their surroundings.Panda cubs have a distinctive white coloration, which gradually turns<br>black over time. Their playful antics and adorable appearances make them a favorite subject for wildlife conservation efforts and attract a lot of public interest and<br>support. Many zoos around the world participate in breeding programs to help conserve this endangered species and raise awareness about the importance of panda<br>conservation.
            <br><p style="font-size:100%; font-family:cursive;">Here is a quote from wikipedia website about a panda cub:
    <blockquote style="font-size:100%; font-family:cursive; border:4px solid black;" cite="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7#%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF_%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7"><b>    Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies.If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the<br>stronger of the cubs, and the weaker cub will die due to starvation. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs since<br>she does not store fat.<br><mark>a panda cub</mark> weighs between 90-130 grams,which is one eight hundredth of its mother's weight. A panda gives birth to between 1 and 2 cubs,and<br>if there are twin cubs,the mother panda abandons one of them and the cub dies immediately.<br>Currently, scientists do not know how and on what basis the female panda chooses one of the two cubs. Maybe it will release the weaker cub but<br>nothing is proven.(The father does not help the cub grow up.)
